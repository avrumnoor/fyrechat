### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avrumnoor/fyrechat.git
cd fyrechat

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash

```

### 3. Set up Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable **Authentication** (Google Sign-In method)
4. Create a **Firestore Database** in test mode (start with “Start in test mode”)
5. Add a **Web App** to your Firebase project
6. Replace the Firebase config in `src/App.js` with your credentials:

```js
const app = initializeApp({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
});
```

### 4. Configure Firestore Rules

> Required to allow authenticated users to read/write messages:

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /messages/{message} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
